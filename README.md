# Tableau Project: Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard in Tableau

## Project Overview

This project explores customer churn patterns using a fictional telecommunications dataset and presents insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The goal was to **expand my data visualization and BI tool expertise beyond Excel** by learning Tableau, applying my existing dashboard design skills in a new environment.

By segmenting churn across tenure, internet service type, contract types, monthly charges, and demographics, this dashboard helps identify **at-risk customer groups** and provides actionable insights for improving retention strategies.

## Objectives

- Strengthen dashboard development skills by learning Tableau
- Analyze churn drivers such as tenure, service type, pricing, and contract length
- Create an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for stakeholder exploration
- Practice visual storytelling with real-world business data

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau Desktop (Trial Version)**
- Excel (for initial data review)
- Calculated Fields (churn indicator, tenure buckets, custom charge tiers)
- Color gradients, filters, tooltips, and layout containers

---

## Key Features

- **KPI Tiles:** Churn Rate, Total Customers, Average Tenure, Monthly Revenue
- **Expanded Tenure Buckets:** 0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, 15–18, 18+ months
- **Churn by Internet Service Type:** DSL, Fiber Optic, No Internet
- **Custom Charge Tiers:** <$40, $40–79, $80+
- **Interactive Filters:** Contract type, Internet service, demographic factors
- **Color-Formatted Tables:** Highlighting churn intensity and patterns

---

## Insights

- **Early churn is the biggest risk:** Customers are most likely to leave within the first 0-3 months.
- **Fiber Optic users churn more:** Higher cost or performance expectations may drive this trend.
- **Higher monthly charges (> $80) increase churn risk.**
- **Retained customers average twice the tenure** of churned customers (~38 months vs. ~17 months).

## Why This Project

While I have **extensive experience building dashboards in Excel**, I took on this project to **expand my BI toolkit** and deepen my knowledge of Tableau’s visual analytics capabilities. This allowed me to practice translating raw data into intuitive, interactive insights using a modern BI platform.

## My Role

- Led the project end-to-end: data preparation, feature engineering, visualization, dashboard design, and insight generation
- Created calculated fields and custom groupings
- Designed an accessible, clear, and interactive dashboard for both technical and non-technical users
